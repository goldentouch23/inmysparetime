<p class="para2">Heyyy, my name is A'daija and I have been a creator my entire life. I have been able to diversify what I am passionate about and share them with you!This website will be dedicated to displaying some of my passions with you all. You'll have the chance to browse tutorials, do some shopping, and learn a new skill. This is an open invite to my world, I hope that you gain new knowledge and enjoy yourself!


<h2> Jewelry </h2>
<p class="para">I remember when I first took an interest in creating jewelry. I was between the ages of 8-10 and I would be a my nana's house. Nana would always let me go thru her jewelry and pick out anything she didn't want anymore, or allow me to fix whatever pieces were broken. She saw that I had a genuine interest in repairing what was tarnished and creating what I could from what was left. From that point on, whenever I would visit her she would take me to Micheals or Walmart to pick out all the supplies I needed in order to make earrings, bracelets, and neckalaces. My nana and mother would always encourage me to keep creating new pieces, I would often show them what I created and they would proudly wear the custom jewelry. Recently I started creating jewelry again, and it has been very fulfilling when it comes to feeding my inner child. My family has been so supportive when it comes to what I love to do. Having people who see and want you to operate in your gifts is important. If you are here and may not have any family or friends that can provide support, then please allow me. I believe in you, your talents are unique, and NOBODY can do it like YOU! Trust God and trust yourself, know that you are important as well as the gifts inside of you. By going to the "Jewelry" tab you will be shown step by step tutorials, as well as my online jewelry shop.</p>

<h2> Cosmetics </h2>
<p class="para">As a child and into to early teenage years, I would watch my mother do her makeup. I was fascinated by her technique, the process, and final outcome, I loved seeing the colors she would use and how they would enhance her beauty. Eyeliner was my thing in highschool I absolutely loved it and I still do! During my freshman year of college I took an interest in doing my eyebrows, and let me tell you they were a hot mess but at the time I loved them lol. So I started doing my research when it came to knowing what eyebrow shape complemented my face and the proper products to use, I practiced on my sisters as well.During my time in college, my progress became visible to the point where my friends would ask if I could do their eye makeup and brows. Over the years I have dedicated time to improve my brow routine to the point where people have stopped and asked me what's my technique and "Are you a makeup artist?". In addition to makeup I also took an interest in lashes,I loved the different styles and lengths. My younger sisters and I would often go to the beauty supply store excited about what new lash strips arrived. In due time I became really invested in lashes and started to apply the clusters to not only myself but clients as well (My mother owned a hair salon at the time). From lash clusters, I looked in to the art of lash extensions. In 2022 I took a lash course to became a certified lash tech,creating lash extension strips and actually applying lash extensions. Here you will be able to locate and view tutorials on eyebrow filling, lash strip appliaction, maitenance, etc.</p>

<h2>Artistry</h2>
<p class="para">I have been creating for as long as I can remember and thats been a long time. I have always loved drawing, painting, and writing! When I was a child my mom would often buy me art kits every year for my birthday and christmas for yearssss. I believe she was the first person who saw and fed my artistic hunger. Drawing has always been an outlet for me, I am natural a introvert so my mind is constantly coming up with new ideas. Drawing became one of my first sources when it came to expressing myself and bringing whats inside of me to life. Whether it's painting, drawing, sketching, or any media...I am a creator and always will be!

<h2>Web and Graphic Design</h2>
<p class="para">
Web and Graphic design is something that's fairly new to me however, I have grown to love these new skills. Being able to code and build a website from scratch can beintimadating but the outcome can be rewarding. Just like artistry you go through a list of ideas,some sketching, keep in mind of our audience, and a plan to execute.</p>
