<p class="para"> Like I said before web and graphic design is a fairly new to me BUTTT is also another outlet for me when it comes to creating. Web and Graphic design is something that's fairly new to me however, I have grown to love these new skills. Being able to code and build a website from scratch can beintimadating but the outcome can be rewarding. Just like artistry you go through a list of ideas,some sketching, keep in mind of our audience, and a plan to execute.</p>
